<h1>My Profile</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>Name: Annisa Maharanti</p>
<p>Student Number: s3724269</p>
<p>Age: 20</p>
<p>Cultural Background: Indonesian</p>
<p>Nationality: Australian</p>
<p>In addition to the basic information stated above, education wise, I completed secondary education or high school in 2017 and proceeded to attempt an Advanced Diploma of Engineering (Aeronautical) at RMIT the following year before enrolling in the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT through Open University Australia this year. I often find myself spending my free time by watching K-Dramas, which stands for Korean Dramas, or watching comedic content on YouTube. I find myself still figuring out what my hobbies are or what my hobbies can potentially be, so I wouldnâ€™t say that I have specific hobbies, but I do enjoy learning how to cook currently.</p>
